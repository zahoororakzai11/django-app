This repository contains a Django REST Framework (DRF) based project focusing on building and testing APIs. The main features include:

Authentication: Implemented robust authentication mechanisms to secure the APIs.
Postman API Testing: Comprehensive API testing using Postman to ensure all endpoints work as expected.
Models: Defined database models to structure and manage the application's data.
Serializers: Created serializers to transform complex data types to JSON and vice versa.
ViewSets: Utilized viewsets to handle CRUD operations efficiently.
Routers: Configured routers to manage URL routing for the API endpoints seamlessly.
Explore the project to understand how to build a scalable and testable API with Django REST Framework.
